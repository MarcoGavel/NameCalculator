# NameCalculator
A little name calculator exercise!
This code sets up a simple web application using JavaScript with the Express.js framework. It imports the necessary modules, including express for creating the web application and body-parser for parsing incoming request data. The Express application is created, specifying the port number as 3000. Body parsing middleware is configured to parse URL-encoded data. Two routes are defined: a GET route for the "/" path, which renders an index.ejs template, and a POST route for the "/submit" path, which calculates the number of letters in the first and last names submitted by the client and renders a solution.ejs template with the calculated number of letters passed as a variable. Finally, the server is started, and a message is logged to the console confirming the server's successful startup.
